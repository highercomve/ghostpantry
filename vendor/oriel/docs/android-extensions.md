# App-owned Android extensions

Use `OrielAndroidExtension` to add native Android behavior without editing
Oriel's generated Kotlin runtime. Extensions can configure WebViews, react to
Activity and WebView lifecycles, launch native workflows, handle permissions
and activity results, and intercept file selection. The API is independent of
any particular app, camera implementation, or third-party SDK.

## Register an extension

Keep the implementation outside the generated `android/app/src/main/java/`
directory, for example in `src/android/MyExtension.kt`:

```kotlin
package dev.example

import android.webkit.WebView
import dev.oriel.OrielAndroidExtension

class MyExtension : OrielAndroidExtension {
    override fun onWebViewCreated(view: WebView, windowLabel: String) {
        // Apply an app-specific setting after Oriel installs its clients and
        // bridge, before the page loads. Other windows can use other settings.
        if (windowLabel == "main") view.settings.textZoom = 110
    }
}
```

Register the source and fully qualified class in `build.zig`:

```zig
_ = oriel.addApp(b, dep, .{
    .name = "my-app",
    .root_source_file = b.path("src/main.zig"),
    .android = .{
        .sources = &.{b.path("src/android/MyExtension.kt")},
        .extensions = &.{"dev.example.MyExtension"},
    },
});
```

A registered class must implement `OrielAndroidExtension` and have a public
zero-argument constructor. Register multiple classes in the order they should
run. Duplicate registrations, invalid class names, and more than 64 extensions
are rejected by the build. Kotlin compilation checks the interface and
constructor; registration uses direct constructor calls, not reflection, so
R8 can follow those references.

Every Android build copies the listed sources and regenerates
`dev/oriel/OrielAppExtensions.kt`. Removing a registration removes its wiring;
removing a source removes its generated copy. The original source remains
owned by the developer. Normal builds keep developer manifest entries outside
Oriel's generated regions. Add custom Activities, providers, or services there,
and declare extra permissions with `.android.permissions` or the appropriate
`.permissions` kind. `-Dandroid_force=true` intentionally rewrites developer
project files from the template; it is not needed to update extensions.

## Lifecycle and WebView hooks

Extension instances are created once per process. Callbacks run on the UI
thread, in registration order. Activity creation/start/resume/pause/stop/destroy,
new intents, saved instance state, and configuration changes are available.
WebView creation, attachment, detachment, and destruction callbacks include the
window label. Activity and WebView lifetimes differ: a WebView can survive an
Activity, and a renderer crash creates a new WebView for the same window.

Keep state per Activity or WebView instead of retaining one global host. Release
callbacks, URI grants, listeners, and other resources in the appropriate cleanup
hook. Constructors and `onRegistered` must not assume an Activity exists. Preserve
Oriel's clients, JavaScript bridge, and navigation restrictions; use the provided
hooks to intercept behavior instead of replacing `webViewClient` or
`webChromeClient`. WebView hooks are not called for the native UI renderer.

## Native requests without request-code collisions

`onRegistered` supplies an `OrielAndroidExtensionContext`. Allocate local codes
from 0 through 255; Oriel assigns each extension a separate namespace:

```kotlin
private lateinit var context: OrielAndroidExtensionContext

override fun onRegistered(context: OrielAndroidExtensionContext) {
    this.context = context
}

// When handling an app action:
// activity.startActivityForResult(intent, context.requestCode(1))
// activity.requestPermissions(arrayOf(permission), context.requestCode(2))
```

Oriel routes results for those codes directly to the owning extension. Return
`true` from `onActivityResult` or `onRequestPermissionsResult` when handled.
Oriel's request codes (`0x4F00..0x4FFF`) are reserved. For third-party SDKs with
fixed codes, use codes outside Oriel's reserved range and the extension-managed
range (`0x8000..0xBFFF`); those results visit extensions in declaration order
until one returns `true`, then fall back to the Activity.

## Intercept file selection

Override `onShowFileChooser(activity, view, callback, params)` to provide a
custom picker, capture workflow, or document SDK. Return `false` without touching
the callback to let the next extension, then Oriel's built-in picker, handle it.
Return `true` to take ownership and complete the callback exactly once with the
selected URI array, or `null` for cancellation/failure. Clean up an outstanding
callback when its Activity or WebView is destroyed. Honour the supplied accept
types, capture flag and selection mode; do not request unrelated permissions.

For Android gallery/file inputs, selected files arrive as `content://` URIs.
An app that needs those can opt in with `view.settings.allowContentAccess = true`
in `onWebViewCreated`. Oriel keeps this disabled by default. Camera capture can
use an app-owned content provider with a scoped URI write grant and
`MediaStore.EXTRA_OUTPUT`; the activity-result hook can return that URI even
when Android returns a null result Intent.

## Third-party SDK dependencies

Declare pinned Maven coordinates in the same build configuration as the extension:

```zig
.android = .{
    .sources = &.{b.path("src/android/MyExtension.kt")},
    .extensions = &.{"dev.example.MyExtension"},
    .dependencies = &.{"com.example:example-sdk:1.2.3"},
    .proguard_rules = b.path("src/android/proguard-rules.pro"),
},
```

Every build writes `app/oriel-dependencies.gradle` and maintains its
`apply(from = ...)` line between `// oriel:dependencies` markers in
`app/build.gradle.kts`. Manual Gradle dependencies and settings outside the
markers are preserved. Removing a coordinate removes it from the generated
script. Full project regeneration installs the same dependencies automatically.
Coordinates accept exactly `group:artifact:version`, with letters, digits,
dots, underscores, and hyphens; code injection and floating versions are rejected.
The project must still configure repositories and a Kotlin/AGP toolchain
compatible with the SDK. New projects use Kotlin 2.3.21 and AGP 8.13.2; existing
projects keep their developer-owned Gradle files and may need an explicit upgrade. Native methods called through JNI need app-owned R8
keep rules, because shrinking cannot infer those calls from Zig.
